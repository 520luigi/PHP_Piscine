<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles 4x4 Matrices.
There are 7 class constants :
IDENTITY    = 'IDENTITY',
SCALE       = 'SCALE',
RX          = 'Ox ROTATION',
RY          = 'Oy ROTATION',
RZ          = 'Oz ROTATION',
TRANSLATION = 'TRANSLATION',
PROJECTION  = 'PROJECTION';

On which depends the following arguments respectively :
IDENTITY    ->nothing
SCALE       -> the scale
RX          -> angle of rotation
RY          -> angle of rotation
RZ          -> angle of rotation
TRANSLATION -> vector ( class Vector ) of the translation
PROJECTION  -> Field of view ( in degrees ), Ratio (width/height of screen), near and far z distances

When a Matrix is created, you wont be able to change its values after.
aka-> no setters;

The following method are providing for this Class:

- mult() : return a new matrix by the multiplication of both matrices

- transformVertex() : return a new Vertex resulting from the transformation of the vertex by matrix
