# PHP_Piscine
Learn web development in this mini piscine.

### Day 00
Completed 5/6 Exercises

### Day 01
Completed 12/14 Exercises (The 2nd ssap is not right, but o-well). Might only
get credit of 9/14. For 2nd do_op. I had to take consideration of negative value
case like "4 - -3" and my program doesn't. So it is incorrect implementation.
Also, when I test the files for special characters like # and * will break the
terminal commands, so be sure to use backslash # or backslash * instead.

### Day 02
Did 1/6 Exercises, the 2nd exercise has a wrong output on PDF. I'm gonna skip
the day and move on to day 03. Gonna take a lost here b/c it will take a while
to do this day and I don't understand much.

### Day 03
Did 6/7 Exercises, the 1st exercise tells us to use PAMP tool from 42, but it is
outdated, so I used MAMP instead. Basically, I opened up MAMP and set root directory
to where my exercises are. There I can access them on the browser using local host
and port. I need the files run on the browser before using curl to call on my terminal.

### Day 04
Did 4/5 Exercises, all focused on login, modify passwords, and the like.

### RUSH00
Did the ecommerce website of Pokemon Plushies. Took a very long time during the past two
days because it was supposed to be from scratch. I used Udemy tutorial to make this. There are
quite a few bugs around like not being able to change multiply quantities of plushies. Or that
if you got to certain pages, the add to cart button won't work. I know that these bugs are fixable
over time, but this is only a 2 day project. It was mad fun, and I got in less than 2 hours
of sleep yesterday, but was worth the fun. I turned in a mySQL dump file and a install.php file that
both initialize the database. In case one doesn't work, I got the other.
