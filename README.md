# PHP_Piscine
Learn web development in this mini piscine.

### Day 00
Completed 5/6 Exercises

### Day 01
Completed 12/14 Exercises (The 2nd ssap is not right, but o-well). Might only
get credit of 9/14. For 2nd do_op. I had to take consideration of negative value
case like "4 - -3" and my program doesn't. So it is incorrect implementation.
Also, when I test the files for special characters like # and * will break the
terminal commands, so be sure to use \# or \* instead.

### Day 02
Did 1/6 Exercises, the 2nd exercise has a wrong output on PDF. I'm gonna skip
the day and move on to day 03. Gonna take a lost here.

### Day 03
Did 6/7 Exercises, the 1st exercise tells us to use PAMP tool from 42, but it is
outdated, so I used MAMP instead. Basically, I opened up MAMP and set root directory
to where my exercises are. There I can access them on the browser using local host
and port. I need the files run on the browser before using curl to call on my terminal.
