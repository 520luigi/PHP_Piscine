### Day 00 (HTML/CSS) 90/100
Completed 5/6 Exercises

### Day 01 (Intro to PHP) 62/100
Completed 12/14 Exercises (The 2nd ssap is not right, but o-well). Might only
get credit of 9/14. For 2nd do_op. I had to take consideration of negative value
case like "4 - -3" and my program doesn't. So it is incorrect implementation.
Also, when I test the files for special characters like # and * will break the
terminal commands, so be sure to use backslash # or backslash * instead.

### Day 02 (Harder PHP) 0/100
Did 1/6 Exercises, the 2nd exercise has a wrong output on PDF. I'm gonna skip
the day and move on to day 03. Gonna take a lost here b/c it will take a while
to do this day and I don't understand much.

### Day 03 (myphpAdmin, MAMP) 92/100
Did 6/7 Exercises, the 1st exercise tells us to use PAMP tool from 42, but it is
outdated, so I used MAMP instead. Basically, I opened up MAMP and set root directory
to where my exercises are. There I can access them on the browser using local host
and port. I need the files to run on the browser before using curl to call on my terminal.

### Day 04 (MAMP HTML/PHP Integration, Login/AUTH/etc) 57/100
Did 4/5 Exercises, all focused on login, modify passwords, and the like.

### RUSH00 (Ecommerce Website) 100/100
Did the ecommerce website of Pokemon Plushies. Took a very long time during the past two
days because it was supposed to be from scratch. I used Udemy tutorial to make this. There are
quite a few bugs around like not being able to change multiply quantities of plushies. Or that
if you got to certain pages, the add to cart button won't work. I know that these bugs are fixable
over time, but this is only a 2 day project. It was mad fun, and I got in less than 2 hours
of sleep yesterday, but was worth the fun. I turned in a mySQL dump file and a install.php file that
both initialize the database. In case one doesn't work, I got the other.

Honestly my sites have a lot of bugs. It is not optimized and missed a lot of features of customers and
admin, but my graders were very generous, so I got full credit despite not deserving it.

### Day 05 (SQL Database) 95/100
Did 21/21 Exercises, they are simple and short, but there could be errors. We'll see. This is moulinette graded, not people.

To use MAMP SQL without downloading, go to MAMP applications folder so that whenever I type mysql on terminal,
it automatically goes to "PATH=/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin:$PATH". Put this path in my .zshrc file.
If I have password and username access, then run: "mysql -uroot -proot" to get to mysql shell.
On the shell, use code word like: 'use' to use which database, 'show' on tables, databases to show them on the
sql terminal. I can use 'source PATH', where path is the location of my sql file, to run my sql files from
another location. Else, just cat the file contents and paste directly into the sql terminal.
Also, use the resource 'base-student.sql' in the beginning so that you have all the necessary tables for all the
later exercises. Do this by running it with source 'PATH'.

### Day 06 (Object Oriented PHP)
Did 4/6 Exercises. These exercises are really long. Each of them takes hours to do. They are not hard, but mostly use mathematical
equations to solve like vertexes, vectors, matrices which is purely math related questions. Just have to convert math to code mostly
despite how long it takes...

To test the exercises: Use the given main_ex##.out to check the output if I compile main_##.php with my file. This ensures that the opp code
that I made has the same output. Once the output is the same, I can say that the exercise I did is correct. I included header of files, so
that it should work optimally without having to add any lines when I test them.

### Day 07 (Object Oriented PHP Continued) 85/100
Did 7/7 Exercises. These exercises are short and based on Game of Throne. It basically utilized test cases, around you have to make simple class to complement them. Pretty decent and fun. Should use abstract, so that test2 of ex06 doesn't output anything but fatal error...Also messed up ex03 by not including abstract before class. I fixed it for now, but the score is already decided.

### Day 08 (Object Oriented PHP, making a Starships Battle Game) 0/100
There's only one exercise and that is to make a Starships Battle Game in php. This is honestly a lot of work
for just one day period. Even more work than doing the ecommerce site with a partner, so I'll skip this one...

### Day 09 (JS, JQuery, & More!)
